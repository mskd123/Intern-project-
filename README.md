OVERVIEW

This repository contains four mini-projects developed during the Python internship at CodeAlpha. Each task demonstrates real-world Python applications, including games, automation, AI-based interaction, and financial utilities.

 TASK 1 – HANGMAN GAME
 Description:
A terminal-based Hangman game built using Python. The player guesses letters to figure out a hidden word. Incorrect guesses draw a stickman step by step until the game ends.

 Concepts Used:

  TASK 2 – CHATBOT IN PYTHON 
Description:
A simple rule-based chat bot that simulates conversation with a user. It responds to greetings, questions, and common statements using if-else logic.

Concepts Used:
-	While loops
-	If-else statements
-	String comparison and formatting

Features:
-	Responds to “hi”, “how are you?”, “bye”, etc.
-	Mimics basic AI behavior in the terminal


 TASK 3 – STOCK PORTFOLIO TRACKER
Description:
This script simulates a stock portfolio by using predefined stocks and randomly generated prices. It calculates the total value of each stock and the entire portfolio.

Concepts Used:
-	Dictionaries and lists
-	Random module
-	Looping and arithmetic operations


 TASK 4 – TASK AUTOMATION: FILE RENAMER
Description:
Automates the renaming of all files in a specified folder using a consistent pattern like `File_1`, `File_2`, etc. Great for organizing folders.

Concepts Used:
-	Python `os` module
-	File path operations
-	Loops and string formatting

Use Cases:
-	Renaming scanned documents
